`!!!!!!!!!!!!! ATTENTION - THESE SNIPPETS ARE NOT MADE FOR REAL USAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!`

It will grow durign starthack2017. Here you can find some hints for:

0. Basic ideas for app 
1. Basics with tensorflow
2. Sample for speaker recognition
3. Sample for similar voices (recommandation)
4. Inspiration

These snippet will just give you a sample of the power of AI. 
For improvement you need to transform it into an online approach like used in recommendation systems (i.E classic Movie Database problem). Preprocessing the wav files can improve the result as well. For sure a recommendation system could be also built just based on likes without a feature extracted from the wav.

## 1 Getting started with tensorflow

Everything is very well documented on the tensorflow webpage: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started

We recommend the "MNIST For ML Beginners" tutorial.

## 2 Sample for speaker recognition (classifier)

In this example we try to recognize the speaker by a sample. We use in this sample MFCC () as feature. There are many other options to extract features from a speaker.

The MFCC features we extract with <a href="https://github.com/librosa/librosa">librosa</a>

To handle N-dimensional array Objects  this sample contains <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>
