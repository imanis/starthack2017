ATTENTION: THESE SNIPPETS ARE NOT MADE FOR LARGESCALE APPROACHES.

It will grow durign starthack2017. Here you can find some:
 
1. Basics with tensorflow
2. Sample for speaker recognition
3. Sample for similar voices (recommandation)

It will just give you a sample. For improvement you need to transform it into an online approach like used in recommendations (i.E classic Movie Databases)


##1. Getting started with tensorflow

Everything is very well documented.

https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started

We recommend the "MNIST For ML Beginners" tutorial.

##2. Sample for speaker recognition (classifier)
